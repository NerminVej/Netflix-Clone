## Netflix Clone

This is a Netflix clone application built with TypeScript and Next.js. It provides a development environment for building a streaming platform with features like MongoDB and Prisma for database management, NextAuth for authentication with Google, and TailwindCSS for responsive and visually appealing UI design. It incorporates cookie-based authentication for secure user sessions and utilizes React SWR for efficient data fetching and caching. State management is handled using Zustand, ensuring seamless data flow and organization.
